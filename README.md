<h1>Overview</h1> 

This project is a redesign concept of Virginia Form 760 (Resident Income Tax Return) — Page 1, created to demonstrate form layout, document clarity, and user-friendly design improvements. The goal was to reduce visual clutter, strengthen hierarchy, and make key fields easier to scan and complete accurately.
