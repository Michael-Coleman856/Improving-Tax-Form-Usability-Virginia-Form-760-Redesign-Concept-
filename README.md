<h1>Overview</h1> 

This project is a redesign concept of Virginia Form 760 (Resident Income Tax Return) — Page 1, created to demonstrate form layout, document clarity, and user-friendly design improvements. The goal was to reduce visual clutter, strengthen hierarchy, and make key fields easier to scan and complete accurately.

<h1>Overview</h1> 

This is the publicly available reference form layout. The design is structured and compliant, but the density of information and tight spacing can make scanning and completion more difficult for taxpayers.
